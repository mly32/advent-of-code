To compile and run code for day `N`,

```shell
# $N is the day
# version 0 for practice, 1 for final
# question 0 for first question, question 1 for second question
make all DAY="$N" VER="0" Q="0"
```

Change the `VER` argument to run on the final input instead of the practice
input.

Change the `Q` argument to run the second question instead of the first
question.
