To compile and run code for day `N`,

```shell
make all ARGS="$N" # where $N is the day
```

Toggle the variables `final` and `snd_question` in the code to run on the final
input rather than the practice input and to run the second question instead of
the first question respectively (some days' code do not have a `snd_question`
variable when the solution between parts 1 and 2 are combined into a single
`solve` function).
